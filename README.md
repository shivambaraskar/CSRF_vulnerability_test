A Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability also known as XSRF, is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to induce 
users to perform actions they do not intend to perform., which allows an attacker to change the registered mobile number and email ID 
of a victim. This can lead to unauthorized access by intercepting the OTP required for password recovery, ultimately compromising the 
victim's account and victim's account takeover. 
This vulnerability can be easily exploitable on the Mozilla Firefox browsers as Browsers like Crome and edge provide by default security 
measures like SameSite cookie attribute set on Lax. 

** Description **
The web application does not properly validate the origin of requests or provide CSRF token and its verification in request, making it 
vulnerable to CSRF attacks. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to change the registered mobile number and email ID of a logged-in 
user without their knowledge.
